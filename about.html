    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We are a group of students learning to code. We built projects like this to help us grow and learn the skills that we need to make it in this field. But we also wanted to make a product that is relavent, convienient, and beneficial to those who use it. Making other peoples live easier is one of the main reasons tech is so big right now. If we can contribute to that even just a little bit then we have done our job.</p>
